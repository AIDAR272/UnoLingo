## 🛠 How It Works

1. **User Inputs a Word**  
   The frontend captures the word to be translated.

2. **Translation Request**  
   The backend sends the word to the **Google Cloud Translation API** and retrieves the translation.

3. **Display and Store Translation**  
   The translated word is shown to the user and stored in the database for training purposes.

4. **Training Mode**  
   Users practice words by translating them back or matching them with correct translations. Scores are updated based on accuracy.

5. **Progress Tracking**  
   User scores are tracked in real-time, enabling learners to monitor their progress over time.
